# React-Express-Boilerplate
Boilerplate for an react+express app, tailored to my needs


## Usage

Step 1: following command in the root of the project and `app` directory.

```
npm install
```

Step 2: Now that you have all the dependencies, start the server and client at the same time (from the root of the project):


```
npm run dev
```

Your app is now running on port 3000.


Open the app: `http://localhost:3000/`
